## Summary{#summary}

[CashShuffle](https://cashshuffle.com/) is a fully decentralized Bitcoin Cash privacy protocol that matches you with other network participants to collectively shuffle your BCH, combining transactions. This shuffling process obscures your spending history and makes it incredibly difficult for anyone to track your Bitcoin Cash using chain analysis.
