## Summary{#summary}

[Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP)](https://simpleledger.cash/) is a standard protocol for issuing secure tokens on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, similar to the way that ERC-20 is a standard for Ethereum. SLP can be used to create both fungible and non-fungible tokens in an easy and permissionless fashion.
