## Summary

[CashFusion](https://github.com/cashshuffle/spec/blob/master/CASHFUSION.md) provides high levels of privacy via a flexible scheme that allows an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs of non-standard amounts. It provides anonymous, trustless coordination with usually zero-knowledge of linkages revealed to other players or the server.
