## Summary{#summary}

Transaction fees are fees attached to transactions by the sender. These fees can only be collected by a miner after it has been included in a block, which is what incentivizes the miner to do so.

The median transaction fee directly correlates to supply and demand. If there is a large number of transactions and the block size limit is too small to include all of those transactions into a block, senders will "outbid" each other for a spot in the next block by increasing their transaction fee, and effectively incentivizing the miners to choose their transaction over someone else's. This is usually done automatically by the wallet software. If there is a lot of transactions, and the block size limit is large enough to include them all, the average transaction fee will not increase, because there is enough supply to fulfill the demand.
