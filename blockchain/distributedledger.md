## Summary

Distributed ledgers perform the same actions as ledgers (books used to record transactions between peers) but with no [centralized]() entity recording transactions. This means that multiple entities, each with their own computing system, each hold a copy of the ledger. If for instance someone has an idea to change or improve the ledger, they can propose an update, and everyone who holds a copy of the ledger will have the opportunity to vote on it. After an agreement is made regarding the update, a recording is made to the ledger before saving to each computing system with a copy of it. This process is repeated and results in a fully functional distributed ledger, also known as a [blockchain]().
