## Summary

Block Explorers can be used as blockchain search engines to search for any block, transaction (including pending), or address that has been associated with a particular blockchain since its [genesis block](). Each blockchain has its own block explorer, some have multiple, and some websites provide access to multiple block explorers, like [blockchair.com](https://www.blockchair.com/). It's important to note that a Bitcoin block explorer will only be able to search through Bitcoin's blockchain, and the same can be said for all other block explorers.

Block explorers compliment blockchain technology at its core, providing transparency to every user of the blockchain, not just those who know how to navigate it,  and are essential the same way that google is essential to the internet.
