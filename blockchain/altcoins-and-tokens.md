## Summary{#summary}

Knowing the difference between coins and tokens is essential in understanding what the issuer of the coin or token is looking to do with their project going forward. Coins are typically the foundation that tokens look to build upon to improve, but if for any reason developers want to switch from a coin to a token or vice-verse, they can do so with a coin swap.

## Altcoins{#altcoins}

Altcoins, or, alternative coins, typically refer to any coin that is not Bitcoin and has its own blockchain. Each altcoin has its own purpose or goal; Some try to compete with Bitcoin, some work to help improve the cryptocurrency space in parts or as a whole, and some are meme coins, like dogecoin, with no intrinsic value but a large fanbase. Regardless, a lot of these altcoins were built with the same ideologies in mind as Bitcoin, and certainly not all of them will succeed.

## Tokens{#tokens}

Token refers to any cryptocurrency that is built on top of an existing blockchain. The most common type is ERC-20, which means the token was built on the Ethereum blockchain. Most tokens have some kind of coin offering to raise funds, crypto's version of a public offering. There are multiple types of tokens, and each is intended to be used within the project that it was created for, adding value to it. 

**Platform Tokens** are tokens that utilize the blockchains that they're built on to deliver decentralized applications, or dApps, which are apps that run on a peer-to-peer network, like a blockchain. **Utility Tokens** are meant for a specific purpose inside of the (d)app or (decentralized) platform that they were built on and offer either a service or product within. A common use for a utility token is as a payment option within the platform, to the issuer of the cryptocurrency as a method of fundraising - so imagine your favorite brand creating a token on a pre-existing blockchain, and then saying it can be used for payments in store. **Transactional Tokens** are used to transact like the traditional currencies we are used to, but with an added bonus - the ability to transact peer-to-peer, meaning without a central authority or intermediary, like a bank, monitoring the transaction. **Governance Tokens** offer the owners of them the opportunity to take part in decision-making for the project by allowing them to stake their tokens to vote on proposals in their blockchain-based voting system. **Security Tokens** get their value from an off-chain tradeable asset, like stocks or real estate. The distinction between security tokens and that of utility tokens and non-fungible tokens, is that security tokens are designed to represent investments and are fungible between other coins and tokens.

## Coin Swaps / Token Swaps{#coin-swaps-token-swaps}

Coin swaps (token swap meaning the same thing) are used whenever the developers working on a project decide to move the project to another blockchain, along with the users and the coin/token. If the developers decide to move to their own blockchain, they are swapping their token into a coin and likely doing so because their goal was to raise funds on the other blockchain before creating their own, or because they became a large enough application in the space that their vision changed. If they move to a pre-existing blockchain, they are swapping their coin into a token and likely doing so because they are still in need of funding, or they are looking to scale down and contribute to another blockchain. 

There are various reasons as to why a coin swap may occur, but when they do there are some precarious rules attached and some things to remember. If tokens are not registered for migration or put onto a designated exchange that will support the coin swap, the tokens are put at risk to be frozen, or unavailable indefinitely. Developers pushing for coin swaps can choose to exchange their tokens for any rate they like. The most common rate is 1:1, however it could be set at 1:100, meaning that for every 1 token you owned, you will own 100 of the coin if you follow the coin swap steps correctly. The team behind a project's coin swap should constantly be updating their community, so look at the specific project's social media accounts for more information.
