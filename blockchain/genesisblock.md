## Summary

A genesis block is the very first block of a blockchain, and is the only block of each blockchain that has no prior block to reference, so its "previous hash" value is set to 0. The hash of the genesis block is added to each new transaction in the new block, creating a unique hash for the new block. This process is repeated to lengthen this chain of blocks, creating what we know as blockchain, thus making the genesis block a starting point and essential for any blockchain.

The hash for Bitcoin's genesis block is **000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f** and can be looked up on any Bitcoin [block explorer]().
