## Summary{#summary}

[Compound](https://compound.finance/) is an open-source, decentralized protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency, but ultimately plans to further push DeFi to new boundaries by offering more decentralized financial services. Compound has a governance token called COMP, and any user on the protocol with at least 1% of the total supply can submit and vote on Compound proposals.
