## Summary{#summary}

[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/) is a decentralized project and lending platform on the Ethereum blockchain with a governance token (MKR) that can be used to adjust interest rates, and a stablecoin (DAI) soft-pegged to the value of $1 USD. Dai is backed by Ether, which users can lock up in the lending platform in exchange for interest and the option to borrow up to two-thirds of the value of their Ether in DAI.
