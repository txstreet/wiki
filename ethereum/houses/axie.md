## Summary

In the blockchain-based game known as [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), users collect, breed, battle, and more with digital creatures called Axies. Each Axie has unique characteristics and can be sold on the [Axie Marketplace](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/), along with land that can be rented or developed, and other items that affect gameplay. Over time, more experienced players may earn Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) for playing the game, which are the game's native governance tokens.
