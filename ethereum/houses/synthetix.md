## Summary{#summary}

[Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) is a decentralized platform on Ethereum intended for the creation of Synths: on-chain synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets. Born as stablecoin project Havven, Synthetix rebranded and expanded its scope prior to launching on the Ethereum mainnet in February of 2019. As of May of 2021, the Synthetix platform supports over 50 Synths representing fiat currencies, commodities (e.g., gold), cryptoassets, stocks, and indices, although they plan to add more forms of derivatives as time progresses.
