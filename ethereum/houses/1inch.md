## Summary{#summary}

[1inch](https://app.1inch.io/) is a DEX aggregator that finds the best prices from across multiple DEXs by splitting up orders to minimize price slippage. An important part of the 1inch network is the CHI token, which is pegged to the price of gas on the Ethereum network. When Chi is used or burned in a transaction on 1inch, the cost of fees are cut down by up to half.
