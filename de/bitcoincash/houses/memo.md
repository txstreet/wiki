## Summary

[Memo](https://github.com/memberapp/protocol) is an open-source social media protocol built on Bitcoin Cash that describes how actions, like "posting", are encoded. A software named [member](https://github.com/memberapp/memberapp.github.io) makes those actions easily accessible and understandable for social media sites based on the protocol. Social media sites based on the protocol include [memo.cash](https://memo.cash/) (closed source) and [member.cash](https://member.cash/) (open source).
