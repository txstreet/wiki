## Summary

[CashFusion](https://github.com/cashshuffle/spec/blob/master/CASHFUSION.md) was designed to allow users to consolidate their coins after using CashShuffle. CashFusion does this by using a blind verification scheme in which an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs of non-standard amounts is verified by a random player, further obfuscating the transaction history of the coins. It provides anonymous, trustless coordination with usually zero-knowledge of linkages revealed to other players or the server.
