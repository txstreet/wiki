## Summary{#summary}

Non-Fungible Tokens, commonly referred to as NFTs, are non-denominational tokens (think of them like files on a blockchain) that represent ownership of assets in the digital and real world. They have unique characteristics that can be verified and tracked throughout the blockchain, along with the NFT's owner. This ensures no copycats have any validity - should someone decide to download the same file and tokenize it themself, blockchain records will show theirs is not the original. If it can be put on a computer or digitized in any way, then it can be tokenized and therefore turned into a NFT.

## History{#history}
In 2014, the [Counterparty](https://counterparty.io/) protocol was launched on top of bitcoin. At the time, they offered the ability to mint colored-coins, best described as single, non-divisible units. Some classify these as the first NFTs, but the first planned NFTs were Ethereum-based. Showing up in 2015 as part of Etheria, a 33x33 3D map of 457 purchasable and tradable hexagonal tiles representing land that could be built on were put up for sale. Most tiles went unsold until March of 2021 when popularity around NFTs surged and those interested did research on the first NFTs around, buying the remaining 359 tiles in one day.

Many different forms of NFTs have gained popularity since the concept was first created. Artworks, like [Proof of Beauty](https://pob.studio/) (a service that turns hashes of your choice into algorithmically generated artworks inspired by the hashes), and [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) ("10,000 unique collectible characters with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain"), have proven to have real value to collectors, and some have been sold at record-shattering values. Mike Winkelmann, an artist that goes by the name [Beeple](https://twitter.com/beeple) sold a digital artwork titled, “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” for $69.4 million through [Christie's Auction House](https://www.christies.com/calendar?cid=EM_SEM|ACCT:ChristiesBrand|CMP:ChristiesBrandOnlyUS|AG:BrandAuctionExact|ENGINE:GOOGLE|NT:SEARCH|RG:US|BANNER:|IMG:|KW:christies%20auction|MT:e|SID:1000?rnd=1), the largest auction house in the world.

Notable figures across the globe also see the value in NFTs, like Jack Dorsey, CEO of twitter, who sold the first ever [tweet](https://v.cent.co/tweet/20) for $2.9 million on a marketplace for tweets created by [Cent](https://www.cent.co/#Main). Billionaire Mark Cuban has been shown as a top seller on multiple occasions in NFT marketplaces like [Mintable](https://mintable.app/store/Mark-Cuban-Experiment-Cool-stuff-we-create/bf9c271d-c03a-49f4-81f9-95e4c7b20adb) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Youtuber Logan Paul sold moments of him opening Pokémon cards and some Pokémon-themed NFTs for over $5 million on his own [Bondly](https://bondly.finance/) page, which can be found [here](https://shopnfts.net/).

## Dynamic NFTs{#dynamic-nfts}

Most NFTs are **static NFTs**, meaning they can't or don't change. **Dynamic NFTs** are perpetual [smart contracts](#smart-contracts) (smart contracts with no expiration date) that react to external information they receive from [oracles](#oracles). This means that the NFT can change based on on-chain or off-chain data.

Chainlink was one of the first to dabble with dynamic NFTs after creating the Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function). The VRF is used and paired with Chainlink's oracles to provide and verify randomized information on-chain to smart contracts such as NFTs. The process of VRF itself, along with an example of how VRF can be used in dynamic NFTs are shown below.
