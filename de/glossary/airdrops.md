## Airdrops{#airdrops}

Airdrops are a distribution of a token or coin upon launch, each with unique requirements; as a way to reward early adopters, to gain attention and new followers, or to carry out their vision in the event of a hard fork. Airdrops are usually free for participants, aside from a small fee to claim the tokens. Releasing a token via airdrop typically results in a far wider token distribution and a more active community. One example of an airdrop that was intended to reward loyal users is [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org), when they airdropped 400 UNI tokens to anyone that had interacted with Uniswap v1 or v2 smart contracts, and 1000 UNI tokens to anyone who held or had previously redeemed [SOCKS](https://unisocks.exchange/) as of September 1, 2020. An example of an airdrop that intended to gain attention and attract new followers is DFINITY's [Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)](https://dfinity.org/), which rewarded users their token in return for signing up for a newsletter. A common example of a [hard fork](en/glossary/forks) airdrop would be [Bitcoin Cash's](en/bitcoin-cash) hard fork, when it airdropped Bitcoin Cash to [Bitcoin](en/bitcoin) holders at a 1:1 ratio. Many airdrops today work by asking you to follow a few steps, involving twitter, telegram, and maybe an email, though most of them are projects desperate to have holders.
