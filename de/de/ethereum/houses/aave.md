## Summary

<a href="https://app.aave.com/" target="_blank">Aave</a> protocol is a decentralized, open-source, and non-custodial money market protocol. Depositors earn interest by providing liquidity to lending pools, while borrowers can obtain loans by tapping into these pools in both an overcollateralized or undercollateralized fashion. Aave protocol is unique in that it tokenizes deposits as aTokens which accrue interest in real time. It also features access to highly innovative flash loans, which let developers borrow instantly and easily; no collateral needed. With 16 different assets, 5 of which are stablecoins, Aave protocol is the most diverse lending pool in the Ethereum ecosystem.
