## Summary{#summary}

[Curve](https://curve.fi/) is an automated market maker on Ethereum that allows users and smart contracts to trade between stablecoins that are pegged to the same value (like DAI and USDC) using a low slippage, low fee algorithm. Behind the scenes, the liquidity pool is supplied to the Compound protocol, where it generates income for liquidity providers who are also paid in CRV, the protocol's governance token.
