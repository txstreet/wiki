## Summary

<a href="https://www.synthetix.io/" target="_blank">Synthetix</a> is a decentralized platform on Ethereum for the creation of Synths: on-chain synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets. Born as stablecoin project Havven, Synthetix rebranded and expanded its scope prior to launching on mainnet in February 2019. As of May 2019, the Synthetix platform supports over 20 Synths representing fiat currencies, commodities (e.g., gold), and cryptoassets. Stocks, indices, and other derivatives are expected to be added soon.
