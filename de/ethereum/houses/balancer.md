## Summary

<a href="https://balancer.finance" target="_blank">Balancer</a> is a protocol for multi-token automated market-making. It enables portfolio owners to create Balancer Pools and traders to trade against these pools. Balancer Pools contain 2 or more tokens each with arbitrary weights of the total pool value. Liquidity providers are rewarded in the protocol's governance token, BAL, and can use it to submit and vote on proposals to the Balancer ecosystem.
