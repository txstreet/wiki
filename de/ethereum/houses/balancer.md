## Summary{#summary}

[Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) is a decentralized protocol designed for multi-token automated market-making and portfolio managing. It enables portfolio owners to create Balancer pools and traders to trade against these pools. Balancer pools contain anywhere from 2 to 8 tokens, each with customizable weights in regard to the total pool value. Liquidity providers are rewarded in the protocol's governance token, BAL, and can use it to submit and vote on proposals to the Balancer ecosystem.
