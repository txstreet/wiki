## Summary{#summary}

[Aave](https://app.aave.com/) is an open-source, and non-custodial money market DeFi protocol that works similarly to Compound in the sense that it offers lending and borrowing cryptocurrencies. The Aave protocol differs by tokenizing deposits as aTokens which accrue interest in real time and are known as interest-bearing assets. It also features access to highly innovative flash loans, which let developers borrow instantly and easily, with no collateral needed.
