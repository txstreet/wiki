## Summary{#summary}

Similar to 1inch, [Kyber Network](https://www.kyber.network) is a DEX aggregator that finds the best prices from across multiple DEXs by splitting up orders to minimize price slippage. Users of the protocol can vote on proposals by staking the governance token KNC, and are rewarded in ETH for doing so.
