## Summary{#summary}

Hard forks and soft forks are crucial in moving forward with updates and changes to blockchain technology. Hard forks split the network so that an update can pass, while soft forks allow for updates to pass with no splits. Both mechanisms have been used in some of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it is easy to see how it has worked for those who have hard forked to their own chain.

## Hard Forks{#hard-forks}

Hard forks are backwards-incompatible software updates (meaning they terminate connection between new and old nodes) that typically occur when the people involved in the decision-making process of a project or network disagree on an update or if an update is rolled out that conflicts with the rules. When this happens, the blockchain will split in two, purposely ceasing communication between differentiated nodes. One blockchain will keep the original rules, and the other will adopt the new rules. Everything that occurred before the fork will remain on the blockchain records of both forks, but everything after will only be found on the fork that it occurs. This means that whatever coins you had on the original blockchain, you'll have on the new blockchain as well.

In August of 2017, Bitcoin experienced one of the more well-known hard forks, where users that disagreed with the current approach to scaling came up with a new approach - to increase the block size. Those that supported the increase of block sizes migrated onto the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, and those that opposed stayed on the Bitcoin blockchain, later rolling out their own scaling solution.

## Soft Forks{#soft-forks}

Soft forks are backwards-compatible software updates, meaning that everyone running a node will have the opportunity to download and run the new update, and the nodes that don't download the update can still communicate with the nodes that do. They are implemented when an update to the software passes that doesn't challenge already standing rules.

The SegWit soft fork, which occurred on Bitcoin's blockchain weeks after the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, changed the structure of Bitcoin transaction data. Usually something like this would fall under hard fork, but the update was formatted so that old nodes could still validate blocks, just not understand them, so switching to the update allows the nodes to parse additional information, but not switching doesn't cause any issues.
