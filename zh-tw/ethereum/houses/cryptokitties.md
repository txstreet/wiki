## Summary

In <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/" target="_blank">CryptoKitties</a>, users collect and breed oh-so-adorable creatures that we call CryptoKitties! Each kitty has a unique genome that defines its appearance and traits. Players can breed their kitties to create new furry friends and unlock rare cattributes.
