## Summary{#summary}

[**Uniswap**](https://uniswap.org/) is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange running on Ethereum that allows users to provide liquidity between a pair of ERC-20 cryptocurrencies (like ETH/USDC) and earn fees for all of the trades made using that pair. This, in turn, makes Uniswap an **Automated Market Maker**, meaning that trades can be completed with the cryptocurrency in the liquidity pool, whereas centralized exchanges require a buyer and seller to complete trades. On May 5th, 2021, the Uniswap protocol rolled out Uniswap V3, introducing concentrated liquidity in the process. Concentrated liquidity allows liquidity to be provided in specific price ranges. Fees are earned if the pair that liquidity is being provided for is traded within that range, and there is an opportunity to earn a much higher rate of return on small ranges.
