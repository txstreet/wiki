## Summary{#summary}

The block time is the average time between blocks that are found by miners. This average is 10 minutes for both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin, and ~15 seconds for Ethereum. In practice, individual block times will vary above and below these times. Sometimes to a great extent. This average is 10 minutes for both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin, and ~15 seconds for Ethereum.

The block time is enforced by the network through "difficulty", which is a measure of how difficult it is for miners to find a hash in order to create a block.
