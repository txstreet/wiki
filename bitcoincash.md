## Summary{#summary}

Bitcoin Cash and its supporters separated from Bitcoin with the idea of having a cryptocurrency that could be used in everyday transactions. To accomplish this, they increased the size of each block, making their transaction fees far cheaper than most blockchains. 

Bitcoin Cash blocks are visualized on [TxStreet](https://www.txstreet.com) as green buses with the Bitcoin Cash logo and the transaction fee associated.

## What is Bitcoin Cash?{#bitcoin-cash}

**Bitcoin Cash (BCH)** is a blockchain and cryptocurrency that emerged from a hard fork of Bitcoin with the goal of pursuing what Satoshi laid out; A cryptocurrency that could be used daily. The two have mostly similar qualities, the supply is capped at 21 million, they both measure transaction fees in satoshis-per-bytes, they both use the same [consensus algorithm](#consensus-algorithm) (so coins are put into circulation the same way), and everything on each blockchain from before the fork is identical. Where Bitcoin Cash differs is that it has a larger block size and has not integrated segwit or any of the updates Bitcoin has pushed since the fork. The larger blocks result in Bitcoin Cash having less expensive transaction fees than blockchains with smaller blocks, like [Bitcoin](#bitcoin).

## Bitcoin Cash's History{#bitcoin-cash-history}

Since the inception of Bitcoin, there was a known fear that when the network reached a large number of users transactions would be slowed and rather expensive. In 2017, the community was actively looking for a **scaling solution**, meaning they wanted to find a way to increase the amount of transactions per second to accommodate the rapidly increasing amount of users on the network. Developers suggested two different ideas that were then voted on; The first being to change the format of each block to save space (also known as [segwit](#segwit)); The second being to increase the block size. The results of the vote showed 97% of the community voting for segwit, and 3% voting for an increase to block sizes. On August 1, 2017, users that disagreed with segwit being added and still wanted to implement larger block sizes rejected Bitcoin transactions and blocks to make their split onto the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Those holding any amount of bitcoin at the time received Bitcoin Cash at a 1:1 ratio, so those holding 5 BTC were given 5 BCH.
