## Summary{#summary}

White papers and light papers alike serve the purpose of directly informing people in the cryptocurrency space of emerging projects and what they plan on doing, along with how they plan on doing it. White papers typically follow a formal and technical outline while light papers are more focused on making the information easier to understand.

## White Papers{#white-papers}

**White papers** are informative reports that detail an issue along with advocating for their solution. In cryptocurrency, white papers are often issued by blockchain projects to inform readers about new technologies, methods, products, or services that they are bringing to the table. The [Bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) is by far the most popular - it outlines a trustless, cryptographically secured, peer-to-peer payment system. The goal of white papers should not be to pull on the emotional strings of consumers to make sales; They are intended to showcase a project and its capabilities before launch by using facts, diagrams, models, and calculations with the goal of people supporting them in return. The most common order for cryptocurrency white papers to be written in follows as such:

1. Abstract - A summary.

2. Introduction - Describing a current issue and how the project could potentially solve the problem.

3. Technology - Technology within the project.

	3a. Transaction Technology - How the project plans to exchange between people on the network.
	
	3b. Network Technology - How the project plans to send, receive, verify, record, and store data and transactions on the network.

4. Incentive - Why people should be interested in being an active user and node.

5. Emission Plan - How the cryptocurrency coins or tokens will be created and distributed.
  
6. Conclusion - A review.

7. References 

## Light Papers{#light-papers}

To avoid having a strenuous and technical order, many cryptocurrency projects are beginning to release **Light Papers** instead. These are essentially the same as white papers, still detailing projects and their goals, but much easier for readers to digest. To compare between a white paper, the [Cartesi](https://cartesi.io/) light paper can be found [here](https://cartesi.io/cartesi_lightpaper_english.pdf).
