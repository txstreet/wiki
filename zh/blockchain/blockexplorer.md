## Summary{#summary}

Block Explorers can be used as blockchain search engines to search for any block, transaction (including pending), or address that has been associated with a particular blockchain since its [genesis block](#genesis-block). Each blockchain has its own block explorer, some have multiple, and some websites provide access to multiple block explorers, like [blockchair.com](https://www.blockchair.com/).

It's important to note that a Bitcoin block explorer will only be able to search through Bitcoin's blockchain, not Ethereum's, and the same can also be said for all other block explorers. Block explorers compliment the blockchain's ability to store information by providing ease of access and transparency to every user of the blockchain. This makes block explorers essential to blockchains the same way that google is essential to the internet.
