## Summary{#summary}

The [Gnosis Protocol](https://gnosis.io/) is a decentralized, open-source prediction market and DEX with an emphasis on low costs rather than transaction speeds. Users on Gnosis submit their transactions to be batched together by a solver, who finds the most efficient path for the trades in return for 50% of the fees. To maximize liquidity, solvers on Gnosis use ring trades, which are order settlements that share liquidity across all orders rather than a single token pair, and are uniquely suited for trading prediction market tokens.
