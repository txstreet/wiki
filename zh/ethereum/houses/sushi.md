## Summary

The <a href="https://sushi.com/" target="_blank">SushiSwap</a> protocol realigns incentives for network participants by introducing revenue sharing and forum-driven network efforts to the popular AMM model. While Uniswap's liquidity mining ended long ago, SushiSwap's is still ongoing and SUSHI is awarded to any liquidity provider.
