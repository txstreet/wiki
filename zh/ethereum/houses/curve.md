## Summary

<a href="https://www.curve.fi/" target="_blank">Curve</a> is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum (like Uniswap) designed for extremely efficient stablecoin trading low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost. Curve allows users (and smart contracts like 1inch) to trade between DAI and USDC with a bespoke low slippage, low fee algorithm designed specifically for stablecoins. Behind the scenes, the liquidity pool is supplied to the Compound protocol, where it generates income for liquidity providers.
