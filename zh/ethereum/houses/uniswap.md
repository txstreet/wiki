Designed with simplicity in mind, the Uniswap protocol provides an interface for seamless exchange of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. By eliminating unnecessary forms of rent extraction and middlemen it allows faster, more efficient exchange. Where it makes tradeoffs, decentralization, censorship resistance, and security are prioritized. This, in turn, makes Uniswap an **Automated Market Maker**, meaning that trades can be completed with the cryptocurrency in the liquidity pool, whereas centralized exchanges require a buyer and seller to complete trades. On May 5th, 2021, the Uniswap protocol rolled out Uniswap V3, introducing concentrated liquidity in the process. Concentrated liquidity allows liquidity to be provided in specific price ranges. Fees are earned if the pair that liquidity is being provided for is traded within that range, and there is an opportunity to earn a much higher rate of return on small ranges.
