## Summary{#summary}

Bitcoin is the first ever blockchain and cryptocurrency, created by an individual (or group of individuals) who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The goal behind Bitcoin was to create a "peer-to-peer electronic cash system" that takes trust out of the equation, but over time it has become better known as a store of value, like gold.

Bitcoin blocks are visualized on [TxStreet](https://www.txstreet.com) as orange buses with the Bitcoin logo and the transaction fee associated.

## What is Bitcoin?{#bitcoin}

**Bitcoin (BTC)** is the name of the first blockchain and its native cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin blockchain, which is a global revolution in information keeping and the first true peer-to-peer financial network, uses a [Proof-of-Work](#proof-of-work) [consensus algorithm](#consensus-algorithm) to ensure the data contained within transactions is accurate, secure, and can be tracked forever. To keep track of every transaction, the blockchain uses a distributed ledger, meaning that every user of network holds an up-to-date copy of it. The network also ensures that every 210,000 blocks, Bitcoin experiences a **halving** event, which is where the reward that miners receive is cut in half. Bitcoins, the cryptocurrency, are issued through a process called [mining](#mining) and are hard capped at a maximum supply of 21 million. Each bitcoin is divisible up to one hundred millionths, which are known as **satoshis** to honor the name of Bitcoin's creator. Both whole bitcoins and satoshis can be sent, and when done so this registers a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions have fees attached to them to help pay back miners, and these fees are measured in satoshis-per-byte. 

## Bitcoin's History{#bitcoin-history}

Before Bitcoin could be created, the groundwork had to be laid. In the previous several decades, many cryptographers had been researching for a way to send and receive information privately, so that no third-party could interfere. In this search, two cryptographers by the names of [Cynthia Dwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Dwork) and [Moni Naor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moni_Naor) ended up creating Proof-of-Work. In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the person or group of people that created Bitcoin, published the Bitcoin [whitepaper](#whitepaper) which used sources over fifty years old and included how technologies like Proof-of-Work would be implemented. Bitcoin's groundbreaking solution was solving the double spend problem by only allowing the first block to pass through, making cryptocurrencies possible. The genesis block and first Bitcoin transaction between peers both occurred in January of 2009, marking what most would call its birth. The recipient of this transaction was [Hal Finney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Finney_(computer_scientist)), who was known to be a prominent contributor to the Bitcoin project in its early days, but has since passed.
