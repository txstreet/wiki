## Summary{#summary}

Bitcoin is the first ever blockchain and cryptocurrency, created by an individual (or group of individuals) who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The goal behind Bitcoin was to create a "peer-to-peer electronic cash system" without a middleman or intermediary, but over time it has become better known as a store of value, like gold.

## What is Bitcoin?{#bitcoin}

**Bitcoin (BTC)** is the name of the first blockchain and its native cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin blockchain, which is a global revolution in information keeping and the first true peer-to-peer financial network, uses a [Proof-of-Work](#proof-of-work) [consensus algorithm](#consensus-algorithm) to ensure the data contained within transactions is accurate, secure, and can be tracked forever. The network also ensures that every 210,000 blocks, Bitcoin experiences a **halving** event, which is where the reward that miners receive is cut in half. This typically results in a delayed supply shock, which causes a massive spike in bitcoin's (and many other coins) price(s).

Bitcoins, the cryptocurrency, are issued through a process called [mining](#mining) and are hard capped at a maximum supply of 21 million. Each bitcoin is divisible up to one hundred millionths, which are known as **satoshis** to honor the name of Bitcoin's creator. Both whole bitcoins and satoshis can be sent, and when done so this registers a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions have fees attached to them to help pay back miners, and these fees are measured in satoshis-per-byte. 

## Bitcoin's History{#bitcoin-history}

Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the person or group of people that created Bitcoin, published the Bitcoin [whitepaper](#whitepaper) in 2008. The genesis block and first Bitcoin transaction between peers both occurred in January of 2009. The recipient of this transaction was Hal Finney, who was known to be a prominent contributor to the Bitcoin project in its early days.
